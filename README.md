## TextGen(Work in progress)

TextGen is an RNN that takes a vector-based approach to RNNs in java.

## Classes

This contains some of the following classes:

- `App`: the main application.
- `VectorMath`: The class that handles the vector operations and some scalar operations.
- `NeuralNetwork`: Handles the forward and backpropagation of the network and allows for the data structures creation.
- `FileReader`: Preforms the file I/O and encodes characters in vectors.
